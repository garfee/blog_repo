About five months ago, My wife and I left Beijing where we had lived for 11 years,  and we started our new life in Tampa, FL  from scratch. Everything here is challenging, exciting and interesting. Sometimes we cook some chinese dishes to reduce homesickness. We will cook a famous chinese dish call Spicy Chicken, which is  an classic dish of Sichuan Cuisine.

**First things first, let's prepare the ingredients.**

*   1~2 lbs chicken, diced into small cubes. A whole chicken is fine, and the legs are better, but  not the breast.
*   Dried red chilli peppers. Tear each pepper into two pieces
*   Sichuan peppercorn. You can find it in local chinese store, but it's not necessary.
*   Green onion. Cut into segments.
*   Ginger. Cut into slices.
*   Garlic. Cut into slices.
*   Peanut Oil or Vegetable Oil.
*   Light Soy Sauce
*   Salt
*   Vinegar
**How to make it**

*   Stir fry the chicken over high heat, with a little more oil.
*   While there is some water seeped from chicken,  add some vinegar
*   When water is totally steamed, add ginger, garlic chilli peppers, green onion, peppercorn and some salt, keep stir-frying.
*   Fry until the chickens become golden brown, then add some soy sauce.
*   About 1 munite later, the dish is finished.
**Enjoy your creativity!**
